The Communication Layer forms the foundation of the H.I.V.E. Protocol, enabling secure and reliable connections
between AI agents. This layer handles the fundamental aspects of agent connectivity, identity verification, and
capability sharing.

## Layer Overview

## Transport Protocols

The H.I.V.E. Protocol supports multiple transport protocols to accommodate different deployment scenarios:

### HTTP/HTTPS

HTTP/HTTPS is the primary protocol for request-response interactions between agents.

- **RESTful API**: Agents expose RESTful endpoints for discovery, capability sharing, and task management
- **Request/Response Pattern**: Suitable for discrete, transactional interactions
- **Status Codes**: Standard HTTP status codes are used to indicate success or failure

```http
POST /api/tasks HTTP/1.1
Host: agent.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "taskType": "text-processing",
  "inputs": {
    "text": "Process this text for sentiment analysis"
  }
}
```

### WebSockets

WebSockets provide real-time, bidirectional communication for scenarios requiring ongoing connections.

- **Persistent Connections**: Enables real-time updates and notifications
- **Streaming Updates**: Ideal for long-running tasks that require progress updates
- **Lower Overhead**: Reduces handshake overhead compared to repeated HTTP requests

```javascript
// Client-side WebSocket connection example
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://agent.example.com/ws');

socket.onopen = () => {
  socket.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'TASK_UPDATE',
    taskId: 'task-123',
    status: 'IN_PROGRESS',
    progress: 0.75
  }));
};

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Received:', message);
};
```

## Message Formats

All communications in the H.I.V.E. Protocol use a standardized message format to ensure consistency and interoperability.

### Base Message Structure

```json
{
  "messageId": "msg-123456",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-18T12:30:45Z",
  "sender": {
    "did": "did:hive:123456789abcdefghi",
    "verificationMethod": "did:hive:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1"
  },
  "recipient": {
    "did": "did:hive:987654321jihgfedcba",
    "verificationMethod": "did:hive:987654321jihgfedcba#keys-1"
  },
  "messageType": "TASK_REQUEST",
  "payload": { /* message-specific content */ },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
    "created": "2025-07-18T12:30:45Z",
    "verificationMethod": "did:hive:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
    "proofPurpose": "authentication",
    "proofValue": "z58DAdFfa9SkqZMVPxAQpic6FNGVeCcW7reirYHuF2i1eFUXdpzVoNXn7RNmwevYcK7Sn" 
  }
}
```

## Security & Authentication

The Communication Layer incorporates robust security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of agent
interactions.

### Message Authentication

- All messages include a cryptographic proof created using the sender's verification method
- Recipients verify the proof using the verification method referenced in the sender's DID Document
- Supports multiple proof formats including Ed25519Signature2020 and JsonWebSignature2020
- Ensures message authenticity and non-repudiation with standards-based verification

### Transport Security

- TLS encryption for all HTTP and WebSocket connections
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) supported for enhanced security in high-sensitivity deployments
- Certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks

### Authentication Methods

- **DID Authentication**: Primary authentication mechanism using DID verification methods
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Optional authentication using W3C Verifiable Credentials
- **DID-based JWT**: JWT tokens that incorporate DIDs for enhanced security and context
- **API Keys**: Simplified authentication for controlled environments (with DID association)

## Integration with Other Layers

The Communication Layer works seamlessly with other H.I.V.E. Protocol components:

- Provides the foundation for [Agent Identity & Discovery](/docs/protocol/layers/discovery-identity)
- Enables secure message exchange for [Agent Collaboration](/docs/protocol/layers/collaboration)
- Supports the execution of the [Task Lifecycle](/docs/protocol/structure/lifecycle)

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing the Communication Layer, developers should consider:

- Network reliability and latency requirements
- Message size limitations
- Rate limiting and throttling strategies
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Logging and monitoring capabilities

<Callout type="warning">
  The Communication Layer must handle network failures gracefully. Implement proper error handling and retry
    mechanisms to ensure reliable agent interactions.
