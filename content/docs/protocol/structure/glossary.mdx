### I

**IK Handshake Pattern**: A specific handshake pattern within the Noise Protocol Framework used by H.I.V.E. for
mutually authenticated key exchange.

**In-Progress**: A [Task Lifecycle](task-lifecycle.mdx) state indicating that an agent has commenced execution of a
task.

**Interaction & Trust Layer**: The H.I.V.E. layer governing secure negotiation, task execution, and verifiable task
completion.

**IPFS**: InterPlanetary File System. A distributed network protocol often recommended for out-of-band transfer of
large results.

as per WebSockets.
