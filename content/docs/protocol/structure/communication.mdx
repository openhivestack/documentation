The H.I.V.E. Protocol's communication layer is designed around an HTTP-first approach for maximum simplicity, compatibility, and ease of implementation.

## Design Philosophy

- ✅ **Universal support**: Every platform and language supports HTTP.
- ✅ **Existing infrastructure**: Leverage load balancers, CDNs, and monitoring tools.
- ✅ **Simple debugging**: Use familiar tools like curl, Postman, and browser dev tools.
- ✅ **Fast implementation**: No complex protocol handling is needed for basic agents.

## Essential HTTP Endpoints

For Tier 1 compliance, an agent only needs to implement three simple endpoints.

### 1. `POST /tasks` - Task Processing

This is the primary endpoint for receiving and processing tasks.

```http
POST /tasks HTTP/1.1
Host: agent.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "from": "hive:agentid:client123",
  "to": "hive:agentid:agent456",
  "type": "task_request",
  "data": {
    "task_id": "task-789",
    "capability": "text-processing",
    "text": "hello world",
    "operation": "uppercase"
  },
  "sig": "ed25519_signature"
}
```

### 2. `GET /capabilities` - Discovery

This endpoint allows other agents to discover what capabilities this agent offers.

```http
GET /capabilities HTTP/1.1
Host: agent.example.com

# Response:
{
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "id": "text-processing",
      "input": { "text": "string", "operation": "string" },
      "output": { "result": "string" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. `GET /status` - Health Check

A simple endpoint to check if the agent is online and operational.

```http
GET /status HTTP/1.1
Host: agent.example.com

# Response:
{
  "agent_id": "hive:agentid:agent456",
  "status": "online",
  "capabilities": ["text-processing"]
}
```

## Optional Enhancements (Tier 2+)

### WebSockets for Real-Time Updates

For long-running tasks that require progress updates, Tier 2 introduces optional WebSocket support.

```javascript
// Simple WebSocket addition to a Tier 1 agent
const WebSocket = require("ws");
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 3001 });

wss.on("connection", (ws) => {
  ws.on("message", (data) => {
    const message = JSON.parse(data);
    if (message.type === "task_update") {
      // Broadcast progress to interested clients
    }
  });
});
```

### Message Compression

For high-frequency communication or large payloads, standard HTTP compression like Gzip can be used.

## Transport Security

Security is essential. The protocol mandates two key security measures for transport.

1.  **TLS Encryption**: All HTTP communications MUST be over TLS (HTTPS) in production.
2.  **Ed25519 Signatures**: All messages MUST be cryptographically signed to verify the sender's identity and ensure message integrity. See the [Security](/docs/protocol/structure/security) documentation for details.

## Implementation for Scale

For large-scale systems with many agents, consider these standard web performance optimizations:

- **Connection Pooling & Keep-Alive**: Reuse TCP connections to reduce latency.
- **Message Batching**: Combine multiple small messages into a single HTTP request for high-frequency interactions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect your agent from denial-of-service attacks.

  **HTTP-First Benefits**: By focusing on HTTP, you can leverage existing
  infrastructure like load balancers, CDNs, and monitoring tools without
  additional complexity.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Security**: Always use TLS in production. HTTP is only acceptable for local
  development and testing.
