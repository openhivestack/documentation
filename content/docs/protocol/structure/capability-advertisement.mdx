Capability Advertisement is a core mechanism in the H.I.V.E. Protocol that enables agents to communicate what they
can do. This standardized approach allows agents to discover each other based on their abilities and requirements.

## Capability Description Format

Agents advertise their capabilities using a standardized JSON format that provides detailed information about what
functions they can perform:

```json
{
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "id": "text-translation",
      "version": "1.0",
      "name": "Text Translation",
      "description": "Translates text between different languages",
      "categories": ["language", "text-processing"],
      "supportedLanguages": ["en", "es", "fr", "de", "zh", "ja"],
      "parameters": {
        "sourceLanguage": {
          "type": "string",
          "required": true,
          "description": "Source language code (ISO 639-1)",
          "enum": ["en", "es", "fr", "de", "zh", "ja"]
        },
        "targetLanguage": {
          "type": "string",
          "required": true,
          "description": "Target language code (ISO 639-1)",
          "enum": ["en", "es", "fr", "de", "zh", "ja"]
        },
        "text": {
          "type": "string",
          "required": true,
          "description": "Text to translate",
          "maxLength": 10000
        },
        "preserveFormatting": {
          "type": "boolean",
          "required": false,
          "default": true,
          "description": "Whether to preserve formatting in the translated text"
        },
        "domain": {
          "type": "string",
          "required": false,
          "description": "Specialized domain for translation",
          "enum": ["general", "technical", "medical", "legal", "financial"],
          "default": "general"
        }
      },
      "returns": {
        "translatedText": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The translated text"
        },
        "confidence": {
          "type": "number",
          "description": "Confidence score between 0 and 1"
        },
        "detectedLanguage": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Detected source language if not specified"
        }
      },
      "examples": [
        {
          "description": "Translate from English to Spanish",
          "request": {
            "sourceLanguage": "en",
            "targetLanguage": "es",
            "text": "Hello world"
          },
          "response": {
            "translatedText": "Hola mundo",
            "confidence": 0.98
          }
        }
      ],
      "performance": {
        "averageResponseTime": 0.8,
        "throughput": "5000 chars/second",
        "costPerUnit": {
          "unit": "1000 characters",
          "cost": 0.01
        }
      },
      "availability": {
        "uptime": 0.998,
        "rateLimits": {
          "requestsPerMinute": 100,
          "tokensPerDay": 1000000
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Capability Components

### Basic Information

| Field         | Description                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `id`          | Unique identifier for the capability             |
| `version`     | Version of the capability implementation         |
| `name`        | Human-readable name                              |
| `description` | Detailed description of what the capability does |
| `categories`  | Tags for categorizing the capability             |

### Parameters

The `parameters` object defines the inputs that the capability accepts:

- Each parameter has a unique name as its key
- `type` specifies the data type (string, number, boolean, object, array)
- `required` indicates whether the parameter is mandatory
- `description` provides human-readable explanation
- Additional validation constraints can be included (`enum`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, etc.)

### Returns

The `returns` object describes the output format:

- Each field has a unique name as its key
- `type` specifies the data type of the return value
- `description` explains the meaning of the return value

### Examples

The `examples` array provides sample usage scenarios:

- `description` explains the example scenario
- `request` shows sample parameter values
- `response` shows expected output

### Performance and Availability

Optional metrics about the capability's performance characteristics:

- `averageResponseTime` in seconds
- `throughput` in relevant units
- `costPerUnit` for fee-based capabilities
- `availability` metrics like uptime and rate limits

## Advertisement Methods

Agents can advertise their capabilities through several mechanisms:

### Registry Publication

Agents register their capabilities with a central or federated registry:

```http
POST /registry/agents HTTP/1.1
Host: registry.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "agentId": "agent-abc123",
  "publicKey": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----",
  "endpoints": {
    "http": "https://agent-abc123.example.com/api",
    "websocket": "wss://agent-abc123.example.com/ws"
  },
  "capabilities": [ /* capability objects */ ]
}
```

### Direct Broadcast

Agents broadcast capability advertisements directly to known peers:

```json
{
  "messageType": "CAPABILITY_ADVERTISEMENT",
  "payload": {
    "capabilities": [ /* capability objects */ ],
    "expires": "2025-07-25T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Capability Endpoint

Agents expose a standard endpoint for capability discovery:

```http
GET /capabilities HTTP/1.1
Host: agent-abc123.example.com
Accept: application/json
```

## Capability Discovery

Agents can discover capabilities through complementary methods:

### Registry Query

Querying a registry for agents with specific capabilities:

```http
GET /registry/agents?capability=text-translation&language=es HTTP/1.1
Host: registry.example.com
Accept: application/json
```

### Direct Query

Directly querying an agent for its capabilities:

```json
{
  "messageType": "CAPABILITY_QUERY",
  "payload": {
    "queryType": "ALL"
  }
}
```

Or for specific capabilities:

```json
{
  "messageType": "CAPABILITY_QUERY",
  "payload": {
    "queryType": "SPECIFIC",
    "capabilityIds": ["text-translation", "image-generation"]
  }
}
```

## Capability Updates

Agents should update their capability advertisements when changes occur:

- When new capabilities are added
- When existing capabilities are modified or removed
- When performance characteristics change significantly

Updates follow the same format as initial advertisements but include version information and change details.

## Filtering and Matching

When searching for capabilities, agents can apply filtering criteria:

```json
{
  "messageType": "CAPABILITY_QUERY",
  "payload": {
    "queryType": "FILTERED",
    "filters": {
      "capabilityType": "text-translation",
      "parameters": {
        "sourceLanguage": "en",
        "targetLanguage": "es"
      },
      "performance": {
        "minUptime": 0.99,
        "maxResponseTime": 1.0
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing capability advertisement and discovery:

- **Accurate Descriptions**: Ensure capability descriptions are accurate and complete
- **Versioning**: Clearly version capabilities to handle compatibility
- **Update Frequency**: Balance between freshness and network overhead
- **Validation**: Validate capability descriptions against the schema
- **Caching**: Implement appropriate caching strategies for efficiency

<Callout type="warning">
  Agents should never advertise capabilities they cannot reliably provide. Misrepresenting capabilities damages
    trust in the network.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  When advertising capabilities, include detailed parameter specifications to help potential requesters understand
    exactly what inputs are required and what constraints apply.
