Task Agreements in the H.I.V.E. Protocol provide lightweight coordination between agents without the overhead of formal contracts. Most agent interactions (80%) don't need complex contracts - simple task tracking is sufficient.

## Tier 1: Simple Task Tracking (Recommended)

**No contracts needed** for basic agent interactions:

```javascript
// Simple task tracking - no contracts needed
const activeTasks = new Map();

function createTaskAgreement(request) {
  return {
    task_id: request.data.task_id,
    requester: request.from,
    provider: AGENT_ID,
    capability: request.data.capability,
    parameters: request.data,
    deadline: request.data.deadline || getDefaultDeadline(),
    status: "accepted",
    created: new Date().toISOString(),
  };
}

// Track task agreement
app.post("/tasks", (req, res) => {
  const taskAgreement = createTaskAgreement(req.body);
  activeTasks.set(taskAgreement.task_id, taskAgreement);

  // Process immediately - no contract negotiation
  processTask(taskAgreement);
});
```

## Tier 2: Lightweight Agreements (When Needed)

**Use lightweight agreements when you need**:

- Multi-step task coordination
- SLA guarantees
- Payment or billing requirements
- Basic dispute resolution

```json
{
  "agreement_id": "agreement-123",
  "task_id": "task-456",
  "requester": "hive:agentid:client123",
  "provider": "hive:agentid:translator456",
  "capability": "text-translation",
  "deadline": "2025-07-18T15:00:00Z",
  "sla": {
    "max_response_time": 30,
    "quality_threshold": 0.95
  },
  "signatures": {
    "requester": "signature1",
    "provider": "signature2"
  }
}
```

**Benefits over full contracts**:

- **90% smaller** than formal contracts
- **Faster negotiation** - essential terms only
- **Easier implementation** - minimal validation required

## Tier 3: Full Contracts (Enterprise Only)

**Use full contracts only when you need**:

- Legal compliance requirements
- Complex multi-party coordination
- Financial transactions
- Formal dispute resolution

```json
{
  "contract_id": "contract-123",
  "task_id": "task-456",
  "parties": {
    "requester": "hive:agentid:client123",
    "provider": "hive:agentid:service456"
  },
  "terms": {
    "capability": "data-analysis",
    "deadline": "2025-07-18T15:00:00Z",
    "sla": { "uptime": 0.99, "response_time": 30 },
    "payment": { "amount": 0.001, "currency": "ETH" }
  },
  "signatures": {
    "requester": "signature1",
    "provider": "signature2"
  }
}
```

### Implementation Checklist

**Tier 1 (Simple Tracking)**:

- [ ] Basic task state tracking
- [ ] Immediate accept/reject responses
- [ ] Simple error handling
- [ ] No contract storage needed

**Tier 2 (Lightweight Agreements)**:

- [ ] Agreement creation and storage
- [ ] Basic SLA tracking
- [ ] Simple dispute resolution
- [ ] Agreement validation

**Tier 3 (Full Contracts)**:

- [ ] Complete contract lifecycle
- [ ] Advanced negotiation
- [ ] Formal dispute resolution
- [ ] Legal compliance features

<Callout type="info">
  **Recommendation**: Start with Tier 1 for all projects. Most successful
  H.I.V.E. deployments never need to go beyond simple task tracking.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Complexity Warning**: Each tier adds significant implementation complexity.
  Only upgrade when you have specific requirements that justify the additional
  effort.
