The H.I.V.E. Protocol defines how AI agents can work together to get tasks done efficiently. This specification
provides a simpler approach to agent collaboration that's easier to implement while maintaining key functionality.

## Overview

The H.I.V.E. Protocol uses a streamlined architecture with two main components:

- **Communication Layer**: Handles how agents connect and identify each other
- **Agent Collaboration**: Manages task negotiation, execution, and completion

This simple design makes it easy to implement while ensuring agents can work together effectively.

## 1. Communication Layer

Agents communicate using standard web technologies like HTTP and WebSockets. The focus is on simplicity and
compatibility with existing infrastructure.

## 2. Agent Identity & Discovery

### 2.1. Agent Identification

- Agents identify themselves using RSA or Ed25519 key pairs
- The public key serves as the agent's unique identifier
- Messages are signed with the private key for verification
- No complex DID resolution required

### 2.2. Discovery

- A simple registry service helps agents find each other
- Agents register with a REST API and can be found by capability
- Lookup returns agent addresses and capability details
- Direct connections are supported for known agents

### 2.3. Capability Sharing

- Agents describe their capabilities in a simple JSON format
- Descriptions include name, inputs, outputs, and parameters
- Registry maintains an up-to-date directory of available agents

## 3. Task Collaboration

### 3.1. Basic Security

- Messages are signed with the sender's private key
- Recipients verify the signature using the sender's public key
- Standard TLS encryption protects all communications

### 3.2. Simple Task Contracts

- Agents use a straightforward task request/acceptance process
- Task contracts specify what needs to be done and expected outputs
- No complex negotiation protocols required

### 3.3. Task Execution

- Tasks follow five basic states: `PROPOSED`, `ACCEPTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED`, and `FAILED`
- For long tasks, agents provide regular progress updates
- Simple error reporting with clear error codes and messages

### 3.4. Results Delivery

- Results are delivered in a standard message format
- Recipients confirm they received the results
- Large results can use file sharing or cloud storage links
