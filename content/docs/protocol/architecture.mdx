The H.I.V.E. Protocol uses a streamlined architecture that enables AI agents to discover each other, communicate
securely, and collaborate on tasks. Its simple design focuses on essential functionality while maintaining
flexibility for different implementations.

## H.I.V.E. Protocol Components

The protocol consists of two essential components:

</Cards>

This simplified architecture enables AI agents to work together effectively while maintaining security and reliability.

## 1. Communication Layer

The Communication Layer handles secure connections between agents and identity verification.

- **Connections**: Agents use standard web protocols (HTTP/WebSockets) to communicate
- **Identity**: Agents identify themselves using simple public/private key pairs
- **Discovery**: Agents can find each other through a central registry or direct connections
- **Capabilities**: Agents share what they can do using standardized descriptions

## 2. Agent Collaboration

The Agent Collaboration component enables agents to work together on tasks effectively.

- **Task Negotiation**: 
  - Simple message exchange to agree on what needs to be done
  - Basic contract format with task details and requirements
- **Task Execution**:
  - Standardized task states: PROPOSED, ACCEPTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED
  - Regular status updates during long-running tasks
- **Results Delivery**:
  - Secure transfer of task results
  - Simple verification of completed work

## Summary

The H.I.V.E. Protocol provides a simple yet powerful framework for AI agents to work together. By focusing on
essential functionality and reducing complexity, H.I.V.E. makes it easier to:

- Connect agents through standard communication channels
- Share agent capabilities in a standard format
- Negotiate and execute tasks between agents
- Verify successful task completion

This streamlined approach ensures compatibility between different implementations while keeping the barrier to
entry low for developers.
