To foster widespread adoption and ease of development, the H.I.V.E. Protocol community plans to develop and maintain
reference implementations and Software Development Kits (SDKs) in various programming languages.
These resources will serve as practical guides and foundational libraries for building H.I.V.E. agents.

## Purpose

Reference implementations provide concrete examples of how to apply the H.I.V.E. Protocol specification.
They serve several key purposes:

- **Accelerated Development**: Provide developers with pre-built components for common H.I.V.E. functionalities
  (e.g., DID management, message serialization/deserialization, Noise protocol integration).
- **Interoperability Assurance**: Act as a "golden standard" to demonstrate correct protocol behavior, aiding in
  cross-implementation compatibility testing.
- **Learning Resource**: Offer executable code that clarifies abstract concepts presented in the specification.
- **Community Collaboration**: Serve as a collaborative hub for best practices and pattern development.

## Planned SDKs and Libraries

The H.I.V.E. Protocol community aims to support SDKs in popular programming environments. Initial efforts will focus on:

- **Python SDK**: Providing a comprehensive library for Python developers to build H.I.V.E. agents.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript SDK**: Enabling H.I.V.E. agent development for Node.js and potentially browser-based
  environments.
- **Rust Crate**: A high-performance, secure library for Rust developers.
- **Go Module**: For efficient and scalable agent implementations in Go.

Each SDK `WILL AIM` to provide:

- **DID Management**: Utilities for `did:key` generation, resolution, and key pair management.
- **Message Handling**: Functions for constructing, signing, verifying, and parsing all defined H.I.V.E. message types.
- **Secure Communication**: Wrappers for Noise Protocol (IK handshake) and WebSocket/TLS integration.
- **Contract Negotiation**: Helper functions for managing the H.I.V.E. Negotiation Protocol flow.
- **Discovery Integration**: Client libraries for interacting with a Discovery Registry Service.

## Contribution & Community Efforts

The development of these implementations will be an open, community-driven effort.

- **Open Source**: All official reference implementations `WILL BE` open-source under a permissive license.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clear contribution guidelines `WILL BE PROVIDED` for developers wishing to
  contribute to SDK development or create their own compatible libraries.
- **Community Examples**: The documentation `WILL FEATURE` community-contributed agent examples demonstrating
  various use cases and implementation patterns.

## Getting Started

Once available, details on accessing, installing, and using these SDKs will be provided on the main H.I.V.E.
Protocol website and within their respective project repositories. Developers are encouraged to monitor these
channels for updates.
