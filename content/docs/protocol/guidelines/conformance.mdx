This section defines the criteria for an agent implementation to be considered conformant with the H.I.V.E.
Protocol Specification v1.0.0. Adherence to these requirements ensures interoperability and consistent behavior
across the H.I.V.E. ecosystem.

## General Conformance

An agent implementation `IS CONFORMANT` with H.I.V.E. Protocol v1.0.0 if and only if it
**fully implements all normative requirements** specified throughout this documentation.

- **`MUST` / `REQUIRED` / `SHALL`**: All provisions marked with these keywords in the specification document `MUST`
  be strictly implemented. Failure to implement any `MUST` or `SHALL` requirement renders an implementation
  non-conformant.
- **`SHOULD`**: Provisions marked with `SHOULD` are highly recommended for robust and interoperable implementations.
  While not strictly required for conformance, ignoring these recommendations `MAY` lead to reduced functionality,
  efficiency, or security.
- **`MAY`**: Provisions marked with `MAY` are optional. Implementers can choose whether to support these
  features based on their specific needs.

## Layer-Specific Conformance

Conformance applies across all defined layers of the H.I.V.E. Protocol:

- **Communication Transport Layer**: `MUST` support WebSockets (RFC 6455) over TLS v1.3+ and adhere to specified
  message framing.
- **Discovery & Identity Layer**: `MUST` use W3C DIDs with `did:key` (Ed25519 or secp256k1), support a Discovery
  Registry interface, and establish secure connections via Noise Protocol (IK handshake).
- **Interaction & Trust Layer**: `MUST` implement message signing and verification, support the H.I.V.E.
  Negotiation Protocol, adhere to the `HIVE_Contract` schema, manage tasks via the defined lifecycle, and ensure
  verifiable delivery.

## Interoperability

- **Test Vectors**: Future versions of this specification `MAY` include explicit test vectors for cryptographic
  operations (e.g., signature generation/verification) and message parsing to aid in interoperability testing.
- **Compliance Suites**: The H.I.V.E. community `PLANS` to develop open-source compliance test suites to help
  implementers verify their adherence to the specification. Passing these suites `WILL BE A STRONG INDICATOR` of
  conformance.

## Extensibility

- Implementations `MAY` introduce non-conflicting extensions to the protocol (e.g., custom `message_type`s, additional
  fields in schemas) provided they do not violate any normative requirements and are clearly distinguishable from
  standard H.I.V.E. elements (e.g., using a custom namespace or `x-` prefix).
- Non-conformant messages resulting from extensions `SHOULD` be gracefully ignored or explicitly rejected with
  appropriate error codes by agents that do not understand them.
