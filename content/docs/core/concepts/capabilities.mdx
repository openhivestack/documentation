import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

In the previous section, you learned how to use `agent.capability()` to create a handler for a task. But how do other agents know what capabilities your agent has, what parameters they accept, and what they return?

This is where the **capability definition** in your `.hive.yml` file comes in.

Capabilities are the formal, public contract for your agent's services. They are the machine-readable "API documentation" that allows other agents (and developers) to understand and interact with your agent reliably.

## The Structure of a Capability

Every capability you define in your `.hive.yml` file must have three key fields:

1.  **`id`**: A unique string that identifies the capability (e.g., `summarize-text`). This is the ID you use in `agent.capability()` and `agent.run()`.
2.  **`input`**: An object defining the schema of the parameters the capability expects.
3.  **`output`**: An object defining the schema of the result the capability will return.

Currently, the schema definition is flexible and used for documentation and discovery, but it will be used for automatic validation in future versions of the SDK.

## Example: Defining the `summarize-text` Capability

Let's take the `summarize-text` task from the previous guide and create a formal capability definition for it in our agent's `.hive.yml`.

```yaml
# .hive.yml
id: hive:agentid:responder-agent
name: SummarizerAgent
description: An agent that can summarize long pieces of text.
version: 1.0.0
endpoint: http://localhost:11101

keys:
  publicKey: "..."
  privateKey: "..."

capabilities:
  - id: summarize-text
    description: "Summarizes a given piece of text and returns a shorter version."
    input:
      text: "string"
      max_length: "number"
    output:
      summary: "string"
```

Let's break this down:

- **`id: summarize-text`**: We've given our capability a clear, unique ID.
- **`description`**: A human-readable explanation of what the capability does.
- **`input`**: We've specified that this capability requires a `text` (string) and a `max_length` (number).
- **`output`**: We've specified that it will return an object with a single key, `summary`, which is a string.

<Callout title="Connecting Definition to Implementation">
  The `id` in your `.hive.yml` is what connects the formal definition to your
  handler code. When you write `agent.capability('summarize-text', ...)`, the
  SDK checks that a capability with this exact `id` is defined in your
  configuration. If it's not, the SDK will throw an error to prevent you from
  implementing an undocumented capability.
</Callout>

By formally defining your capabilities, you create a robust and self-documenting agent that is easy for others to discover, understand, and use. This is a fundamental principle of building a healthy and interoperable agent ecosystem.
