In OpenHive, every agent has a unique, verifiable identity. This is not just a username or an ID from a database; it's a cryptographic identity secured by a powerful public/private key pair (using the Ed25519 algorithm).

This cryptographic foundation is crucial for the network's security and integrity. It ensures that when an agent sends a message, other agents can be absolutely certain who sent it, preventing impersonation and guaranteeing message authenticity.

## The `.hive.yml` Configuration File

While the cryptographic keys are the core of an agent's identity, you rarely interact with them directly. Instead, all aspects of an agent's identity and configuration are managed through a single, easy-to-understand file: `.hive.yml`.

This file is the single source of truth for your agent. It contains its unique ID, descriptive metadata, and, most importantly, its public and private keys.

<Files>
  <Folder name="my-first-agent" defaultOpen>
    <File name=".hive.yml" />
    <File name="src/index.ts" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

When you instantiate an `Agent`, the SDK reads this file, configures the agent, and prepares its cryptographic identity for secure communication.

## Instantiating Your Agent

The primary way you'll work with an agent's identity is by creating an instance of the `Agent` class. The constructor is designed for simplicity—just point it to your configuration file, and the SDK handles the rest.

  <Tab value="Node.js">
    ```typescript
    // src/index.ts
    import { Agent } from '@open-hive/core';

    // By default, the Agent constructor looks for a `.hive.yml`
    // file in the current working directory.
    const agent = new Agent();

    console.log(`Agent ID: ${agent.id()}`);
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    # main.py
    from openhive import Agent

    # By default, the Agent constructor looks for a `.hive.yml`
    # file in the current working directory.
    agent = Agent()

    print(f"Agent ID: {agent.identity.id()}")
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

When this code runs, the `Agent` class:

1.  Finds and parses the `.hive.yml` file.
2.  Loads the agent's ID, name, and other metadata.
3.  Loads the private and public keys into memory, ready for signing and verifying messages.

You now have a fully operational agent with a secure, verifiable identity, ready to communicate on the network.

<Callout title="Generating Your First Identity">
  You don't need to create keys manually. The OpenHive CLI handles it for you.
  When you run `hive create agent`, the CLI generates a new, secure key pair and
  saves it directly into your agent's `.hive.yml` file.
</Callout>
