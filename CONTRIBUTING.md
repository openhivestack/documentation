## 🚀 How to Contribute

There are many ways you can contribute to the H.I.V.E. Protocol:

### 1. Suggesting Features or Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature, a protocol improvement, or an enhancement to existing specifications:

* **Check existing issues**: Before creating a new one, please search through [existing issues](https://github.com/openhiveprotocol/hive/issues) to see if your idea has already been discussed.
* **Open a new issue**: If not, open a new issue using the "[Feature Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)" template. Clearly describe your proposal, its motivation, and potential benefits to the protocol or ecosystem.

### 2. Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, error, or inconsistency in the specification, documentation, or (once available) reference implementations:

* **Check existing issues**: Please search [existing issues](https://github.com/openhiveprotocol/hive/issues) to avoid duplicates.
* **Open a new issue**: If it's a new bug, open a new issue using the "[Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)" template. Provide detailed steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and relevant context.

### 3. Improving Documentation

High-quality documentation is critical for protocol adoption. If you find typos, unclear sections, or want to add more examples or explanations:

* **Fork the repository**: Create a fork of the H.I.V.E. Protocol repository.
