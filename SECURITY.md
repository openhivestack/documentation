# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The OpenHive community takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you may discover.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the H.I.V.E. Protocol specification or its associated reference implementations (once available), please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT open a public GitHub issue.**
2. **Contact us privately:** Email `security@openhive.sh` (Replace with your actual dedicated security email address).
3. **Provide detailed information:**
   - A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any suggested mitigations or fixes.
   - If applicable, include specific links to the affected section of the specification or code.
4. **Allow us time to respond:** We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days and provide a more detailed response within 7 business days. We will work with you to understand and address the issue promptly.

## Our Commitment

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, the OpenHive team will:

- Confirm receipt of the report.
- Validate the vulnerability and determine its scope and severity.
- Develop a fix or mitigation strategy.
- Coordinate with the reporter on a disclosure timeline.
- Publicly announce the vulnerability and the steps taken to mitigate it, giving credit to the reporter (unless they wish to remain anonymous).

We are committed to open and responsible disclosure, ensuring the security of the H.I.V.E. Protocol for all agents and implementers.

## General Security Guidance

For general security considerations related to implementing H.I.V.E. agents, please refer to the dedicated section in our documentation:

👉 **[H.I.V.E. Protocol Security Considerations](https://openhive.sh/docs/protocol/structure/security-considerations)**

This page provides details on the protocol's built-in security mechanisms, threat model, and best practices for secure agent development.
