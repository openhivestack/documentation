# H.I.V.E. Protocol (Hybrid Inter-Agent Verification & Execution Protocol)

## 🐝 Simple Agent Collaboration

H.I.V.E. is a simplified protocol that makes it easy for AI agents to work together. It provides the essential building blocks for agents to find each other, communicate securely, and complete tasks reliably.

This repository contains the official specification and documentation for the H.I.V.E. Protocol.

## 💡 What is H.I.V.E.?

The H.I.V.E. Protocol is a streamlined architecture that enables AI agents to collaborate effectively. It focuses on two key components:

- **Communication Layer**: How agents connect, identify themselves, and share capabilities.
- **Agent Collaboration**: How agents negotiate tasks, execute work, and deliver results.

By using H.I.V.E., developers can create AI agents that work together seamlessly without unnecessary complexity.

## 📚 Documentation

The H.I.V.E. Protocol documentation is available in our dedicated documentation portal.
